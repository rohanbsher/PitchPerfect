---

## Problems Fixed

### Issue #1: expo-audio-stream Swift Compilation Error
**Error**: `cannot find 'vDSP_vgenp' in scope`
**Root Cause**: Missing `import Accelerate` framework in AudioUtils.swift
**Fix**: Added `import Accelerate` to line 3 of AudioUtils.swift
**Patch**: `patches/@mykin-ai+expo-audio-stream+0.2.28.patch`

### Issue #2: expo-dev-launcher API Compatibility Error
**Error**: `value of type 'ExpoReactDelegate' has no member 'reactNativeFactory'`
**Root Cause**: Expo SDK 54 removed reactNativeFactory property, but expo-dev-launcher v6.0.13 still references it
**Fix**: Removed outdated reactNativeFactory references from ExpoDevLauncherReactDelegateHandler.swift
**Patch**: `patches/expo-dev-launcher+6.0.13.patch`

---

## Patches Created

Two patch files ensure fixes persist after `npm install`:

1. **`patches/@mykin-ai+expo-audio-stream+0.2.28.patch`**
   - Adds missing Accelerate framework import
   - Fixes vDSP function compilation errors

2. **`patches/expo-dev-launcher+6.0.13.patch`**
   - Removes references to removed reactNativeFactory API
   - Updates to Expo SDK 54 compatibility

**How patches work**: The `postinstall` script in package.json automatically applies patches after every `npm install`
