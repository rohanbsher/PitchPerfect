# Privacy Policy for PitchPerfect

**Last Updated:** October 28, 2025

## Overview

PitchPerfect ("the App") is a vocal training application designed to help users improve their singing through real-time pitch detection and structured exercises. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information.

## Information We Collect

### Microphone Access
- **Purpose:** The App requires microphone access to analyze your vocal pitch in real-time during exercises.
- **Processing:** All audio processing is performed locally on your device. We do NOT record, store, or transmit your audio data to external servers.
- **Storage:** Audio is processed in real-time and immediately discarded. No audio recordings are saved.

### Exercise Progress Data
- **What We Store:** The App stores your exercise completion history, scores, and progress metrics locally on your device using AsyncStorage.
- **Purpose:** To track your improvement over time and provide personalized recommendations.
- **Access:** This data never leaves your device and is only accessible to you.

## What We DON'T Collect

- ❌ No audio recordings
- ❌ No personal identification information
- ❌ No location data
- ❌ No contact information
- ❌ No device identifiers sent to third parties
- ❌ No behavioral tracking
- ❌ No advertising data

## Data Sharing

We do NOT share any of your data with third parties. Period.

- No data is transmitted to external servers
- No analytics services track your usage
- No advertising networks receive your information
- No third-party integrations have access to your data

## Local Storage Only

All data generated by the App is stored locally on your device using:

### AsyncStorage

This data can be deleted at any time by:
1. Uninstalling the App, or
2. Clearing the app's data through your device's Settings > PitchPerfect > Clear Data

## Permissions Required

### Microphone Permission (Required)
**iOS Message:** "PitchPerfect needs microphone access to analyze your singing pitch and provide real-time vocal coaching feedback."

**Why We Need It:** Real-time pitch detection requires access to your device's microphone to analyze the fundamental frequency of your voice.

**How We Use It:**
- Audio is captured in real-time during exercises
- Processed using the YIN pitch detection algorithm
- Displayed as visual feedback (pitch scale, color-coded accuracy)
- Immediately discarded (not saved or recorded)

**What We DON'T Do:**
- Record your singing
- Store audio files
- Transmit audio data to servers
- Share audio with third parties

### Background Audio Mode (Optional)
**Why:** Allows the App to play piano reference notes even when the App is in the background or your phone is locked.

**Note:** This does NOT enable background recording. Microphone access only works when the App is in the foreground.
