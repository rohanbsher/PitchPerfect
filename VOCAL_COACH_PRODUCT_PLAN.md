# PITCHPERFECT: VOCAL COACH EDITION
## Building the Ultimate Tool for Voice Teachers & Students

*Based on deep research into Singer's Studio, SWIFTSCALES, and vocal coaching needs*

---

- Teacher dashboards - None of them have this

## EMAIL PITCH TO VOCAL COACHES

**Subject**: Stop Wondering If Your Students Practice at Home

**Body**:

Hi [Coach Name],

I'm a developer who built something I wish existed when I was learning to sing:

**A vocal training app that actually tracks student practice.**

Here's what I hear from vocal coaches:

❌ "I assign exercises, but I have no idea if students do them"
❌ "Students say they practice, but I can't verify it"
❌ "I wish I could hear their practice sessions to give feedback"
❌ "Creating progress reports for parents takes forever"

**What if you could:**
✅ See exactly which exercises each student practiced this week
✅ Listen to their practice recordings from your phone
✅ Assign custom exercise plans to each student
✅ Generate progress reports automatically
✅ Send reminders to students who haven't practiced

**PitchPerfect does all of this.**

**For students:**
- Professional pitch tracking (like Singer's Studio, but better)
- Complete exercise library (scales, arpeggios, intervals, warm-ups)
- Real-time feedback while they sing
- Progress tracking to stay motivated

**For coaches:**
- Dashboard showing all your students
- See who practiced, who didn't
- Review recordings and leave feedback
- Assign exercises to specific students
- Generate progress reports for parents

**Try it free for 30 days** - no credit card required.

Then just $29/month for unlimited students.

**[Start Free Trial]**

If you have 10+ students, let's chat about a studio license.

Best,
[Your name]

P.S. Built by a developer who got tired of wondering "am I on pitch?" Now my students never have to wonder either.

### Coach App
- Free: 3 students max
- Coach Pro: $29/month - Unlimited students
- Studio: $99/month - Multi-coach license

**Goal**: 500 coaches @ $29/month = **$14,500/month**

**Total**: $21,500/month = **$258,000/year**

---

## SUCCESS METRICS

2. Accuracy trends
3. Personal bests

**After 30 Days**:

---

## WHY COACHES WILL RECOMMEND THIS

**Pain Points We Solve**:

1. **"My students don't practice"**
   → Now you can see who practiced, send reminders

2. **"I don't know if they're doing exercises correctly"**
   → Listen to recordings, leave feedback

3. **"Parents want to see progress"**
   → Generate reports showing improvement

4. **"I spend too much time on admin"**
   → Dashboard shows everything at once

5. **"Students need tools to practice at home"**
   → Professional-grade pitch tracking app

**What Coaches Will Say**:
> "Since my students started using PitchPerfect, practice completion went from 30% to 85%. I can finally see who's doing the work."

> "The progress reports are a game-changer. Parents love seeing the improvement charts."

> "I assign exercises on Monday, check the dashboard Friday, and give feedback. Saves me hours."

---

## FINAL THOUGHTS

**What Makes This Different**:

1. **Progress tracking** - Competitors don't have this
2. **Teacher dashboard** - Unique to us
3. **Student accountability** - Revolutionary for voice lessons
4. **Recording comparison** - Show improvement over time
5. **Lower price** - $29/month vs $99/month for teachers

**The Vision**:
- Every vocal coach uses PitchPerfect to manage students
- Every student practices with PitchPerfect at home
- Industry-standard tool for vocal training

**Next Step**: Build the scale exercises and prove this works with real singers.
