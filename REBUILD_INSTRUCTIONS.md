# Rebuild Instructions

The first build failed because `patch-package` was in devDependencies instead of dependencies.

## Fixed issues:
1. ✅ Moved patch-package to dependencies
2. ✅ Committed all configuration changes
3. ✅ Bundle ID configured correctly
4. ✅ Apple Team ID set

## Run this command now:

```bash
cd /Users/rohanbhandari/Desktop/Professional_Projects/ML_PROJECTS_AI/PitchPerfect
eas build --platform ios --profile production
```

## What will happen:
1. It will ask if you want to log in to Apple account → Answer: **yes**
2. Apple ID prompt → Enter: **bhandarirohan556@gmail.com**
3. Password prompt → Enter your Apple password
4. 2FA code → Enter the 6-digit code from your iPhone
5. Build will start and run for 15-20 minutes

## After build completes:
```bash
eas submit --platform ios --profile production
```

Then add a screenshot in App Store Connect and submit for review!
