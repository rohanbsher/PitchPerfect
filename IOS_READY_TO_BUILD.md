# iOS Build - Ready to Test

**Status**: ✅ Ready for iOS build
**Date**: October 3, 2025
**Exercises**: 5 (up from 2)

---

## What's Ready

### ✅ Exercises (5 Total)
1. **5-Note Warm-Up** (Beginner, 5 notes, 15s)
2. **Major Thirds** (Beginner, 6 notes, 15s) - NEW
3. **C Major Scale** (Beginner, 9 notes, 30s)
4. **Octave Jumps** (Intermediate, 5 notes, 20s) - NEW
5. **Full Scale Up & Down** (Intermediate, 15 notes, 40s) - NEW

### ✅ Core Features
- Real-time pitch detection (YIN algorithm)
- Hands-free automatic progression
- Professional UI (Apple Design)
- Complete exercise flow
- Results screen with feedback
- Cross-platform audio architecture

### ✅ UI Improvements
- Dynamic exercise list (shows all 5)
- Difficulty badges (Beginner/Intermediate)
- Exercise duration display
- Note count display

## How to Build for iOS

### Option 1: Build for iOS Simulator
```bash
npx expo run:ios
```

**Note**: Simulator does NOT have microphone - pitch detection won't work!

### Option 2: Build for Real iPhone Device
```bash
# First, ensure you have Apple Developer account
# Then build for device
npx expo run:ios --device
```

**Requirements**:
- Apple Developer account ($99/year)
- Real iPhone (any model with iOS 15+)
- Xcode installed on Mac
- iPhone connected via USB

---

## What Works on Web (Test Now)

```bash
# Server already running on port 8082
open http://localhost:8082
```

**Test checklist**:
- ✅ See 5 exercises listed
- ✅ Select different exercises
- ✅ Difficulty badges show correctly
- ✅ Click "Start Exercise"
- ✅ Grant microphone permission
- ✅ Pitch detection works
- ✅ Exercise auto-progresses
- ✅ Results screen shows at end

---

## Known Limitations

### Audio Library Conflict
- Can't install `@siteed/expo-audio-studio` due to Expo SDK version mismatch
- **Workaround**: Using existing expo-av (already installed)
- **Impact**: Slightly higher latency on iOS (100-150ms vs 50-100ms)
- **Acceptable**: Still usable for MVP testing

### Piano Samples
- Currently using Tone.js (web only)
- **For iOS**: Need to download 37 piano MP3 files
- **Source**: Freesound.org (free Creative Commons)
- **Timeline**: 2-3 hours to download and integrate

### NativeAudioService
- Skeleton implemented
- **Needs**: Real-time PCM extraction implementation
- **Timeline**: 4-6 hours with current expo-av approach

---

## Next Steps (in order)

### Step 1: Test Web Version (NOW)
```bash
# Open browser
open http://localhost:8082

# Test all 5 exercises
# Verify pitch detection works
# Check results screen
```

### Step 2: Attempt iOS Build
```bash
# Try iOS simulator first (to check for build errors)
npx expo run:ios

# Expected: Build succeeds, but microphone won't work
```

### Step 3: Decision Point

**If iOS build succeeds:**
- Download piano samples (2 hours)
- Implement NativeAudioService PCM extraction (4-6 hours)
- Test on real iPhone device
- Total: 6-8 hours to working iOS app

**If iOS build fails:**
- Debug build errors
- May need to eject from Expo
- Consult iOS_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_COMPREHENSIVE.md

## User Testing Plan

### Phase 1: Web Testing (This Week)
- Share http://localhost:8082 with 3-5 users
- Collect feedback on:
  - Exercise variety (is 5 enough?)
  - Difficulty levels (too easy/hard?)
  - UI clarity (confusing?)
  - Pitch detection accuracy

### Phase 2: iOS TestFlight (Next Week)
- Build for iOS with real audio
- TestFlight beta with 10-20 users
- Collect metrics:
  - Day 1 retention
  - Average exercises completed
  - Time spent per session
  - Feature requests

### Phase 3: App Store Launch (Week 3-4)
- Iterate based on beta feedback
- Add 5-10 more exercises (total 10-15)
- Implement basic progress tracking
- Submit to App Store

---

## Success Criteria

### MVP Launch Ready When:
- ✅ 10-15 exercises available
- ✅ Pitch detection <150ms latency on iOS
- ✅ 3+ days of testing with no crashes
- ✅ 5+ beta users rate 4+ stars
- ✅ Core flow works end-to-end

### Current Status:
- ✅ 5 exercises (50% to minimum)
- ✅ Pitch detection works on web
- ⏳ iOS build pending
- ⏳ Beta testing pending

---

## Files Modified (This Session)

### Exercises
- `src/data/exercises/scales.ts` - Added 3 new exercises

### UI
- `src/screens/ExerciseScreenComplete.tsx` - Dynamic exercise list

### Architecture (Previous)
- `src/services/audio/IAudioService.ts` - Platform abstraction
- `src/services/audio/WebAudioService.ts` - Web implementation
- `src/services/audio/NativeAudioService.ts` - iOS skeleton
- `src/engines/ExerciseEngineV2.ts` - Cross-platform engine

---

## Quick Command Reference

```bash
# Test web version
npm run web
open http://localhost:8082

# Build for iOS simulator
npx expo run:ios

# Build for iOS device
npx expo run:ios --device

# Check TypeScript errors
npx tsc --noEmit

# Check for iOS-specific issues
npx expo prebuild --platform ios
```

---

**Status**: Ready to test on web, ready to attempt iOS build

**Next Action**: Test all 5 exercises on http://localhost:8082, then decide whether to proceed with iOS build or iterate on exercises first.
