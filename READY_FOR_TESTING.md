# ✅ READY FOR TESTING - Critical Pitch Detection Fix Complete

**Date**: October 7, 2025
**Status**: 🟢 IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE - Ready for User Testing
**Breaking Change**: App now requires development build (cannot use Expo Go)

---

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

### CRITICAL BUG #1: Pitch Detection Not Working ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: Pitch detection was generating simulated 440Hz sine waves instead of reading real microphone input. This made the app completely non-functional.

**Solution**: Replaced simulated audio with real-time microphone capture using `@mykin-ai/expo-audio-stream`.

**Impact**: Pitch detection now responds to your actual voice in real-time.

---

## 📋 Changes Implemented

### 1. ✅ Audio Service Refactor
**File**: `src/services/audio/NativeAudioService.ts`
- ✅ Installed `@mykin-ai/expo-audio-stream` for real-time PCM audio
- ✅ Replaced `generateSimulatedPCMData()` with `ExpoAudioStream.startRecording()`
- ✅ Added `base64ToFloat32Array()` conversion for 16-bit PCM data
- ✅ Configured 44100 Hz sample rate with 2048-sample buffers (~46ms intervals)

### 2. ✅ Development Build Configuration
**File**: `app.json`
- ✅ Added `expo-dev-client` plugin for native module support
- ✅ Generated native iOS project with `npx expo prebuild`

### 3. ✅ Speaker Routing Fix (Previous Session)
**File**: `src/services/audio/NativeAudioService.ts`
- ✅ Fixed iPhone routing piano sounds to earpiece instead of speaker
- ✅ Added dynamic audio mode switching (playback ↔ recording)

## 🚀 How to Build and Test

### Step 1: Connect Your iPhone

1. **Connect iPhone to Mac** via USB cable
2. **Trust the Computer** if prompted on iPhone
3. **Ensure iPhone is unlocked**

### Step 2: Build Development Client

Open a new terminal in this directory and run:

```bash
npx expo run:ios --device
```

**What this does**:
- Compiles the native iOS project with expo-audio-stream
- Signs the app with your Apple Developer account
- Installs the development client on your iPhone
- Launches the app automatically

**First-time build**: Takes 3-5 minutes (Xcode compilation)
**Subsequent builds**: ~30 seconds (incremental)

### Step 3: Grant Microphone Permission

When the app launches:
1. Tap **"Allow"** when prompted for microphone access
2. Microphone permission is required for pitch detection

### Step 4: Test Pitch Detection

#### Test 1: Basic Pitch Detection
1. Tap "5-Note Warm-Up" exercise
2. Tap **"Start Exercise"**
3. Wait for the piano note to play (should come from bottom speaker)
4. **Sing "Ahhhh"** at the same pitch as the piano
5. **Watch the detected pitch change** as you sing
6. Try singing higher/lower - detected frequency should follow your voice

**Expected Result**: Detected pitch updates in real-time, NOT stuck at 440Hz

#### Test 2: Complete Exercise
1. Complete all 5 notes of the warm-up exercise
2. Check the results screen
3. Verify accuracy is > 0% (if you sang correctly)
4. Check that feedback makes sense ("Great job!" vs "Work on C4")

**Expected Result**: Realistic accuracy based on your actual singing

#### Test 3: Piano Speaker Test
1. Go back to exercise list
2. Tap "Start Exercise" on any exercise
3. **Listen for piano sound from BOTTOM SPEAKER** (not earpiece)
4. Verify you can hear the reference notes clearly

**Expected Result**: Piano plays from speaker, not earpiece

## 🐛 What to Look For (Potential Issues)

### Issue: "expo-audio-stream not found"
**Cause**: Development build not created
**Fix**: Run `npx expo run:ios --device` to compile native modules

### Issue: "Microphone permission denied"
**Cause**: User tapped "Don't Allow" on permission prompt
**Fix**: Go to Settings → PitchPerfect → Microphone → Enable

### Issue: "Pitch detection still stuck at 440Hz"
**Cause**: Build didn't include new code or microphone permission denied
**Fix**: Check console logs for audio stream errors

### Issue: "Piano sounds play from earpiece"
**Cause**: Audio mode not switching correctly
**Fix**: Check console for `"🔊 Audio mode: Playback (speaker)"` logs

### Issue: "Build fails with Xcode errors"
**Cause**: CocoaPods or signing issues
**Fix**: Share error message for debugging

## 📊 Testing Checklist

Use this checklist to verify everything works:

### Core Functionality:
- [ ] **Build succeeds** without errors
- [ ] **App launches** on iPhone
- [ ] **Microphone permission** granted

- [ ] **Lock screen** - does exercise continue?

### Performance:
- [ ] **No audio glitches** during exercises
- [ ] **Smooth animations** on pitch visualizer
- [ ] **No crashes** during recording
- [ ] **Memory usage** stable (check Xcode)

## 🎵 How Real-Time Pitch Detection Works

```
[Microphone] → [iOS AVAudioEngine] → [expo-audio-stream]
     ↓
[Base64 PCM chunks every 46ms]
     ↓
[base64ToFloat32Array() conversion]
     ↓
[Float32Array normalized to -1.0 to 1.0]
     ↓
[YIN Pitch Detection Algorithm]
     ↓
[Frequency in Hz (e.g., 261.6 Hz = C4)]
     ↓
[UI Update: Visual feedback + Accuracy]
```

**Latency**: ~46ms (imperceptible to humans)
**Sample Rate**: 44100 Hz (CD quality)
**Buffer Size**: 2048 samples
**Encoding**: 16-bit PCM signed integer

---

## 🔄 Comparison: Before vs After

### BEFORE (Simulated):
```javascript
// ❌ OLD CODE
private generateSimulatedPCMData(): Float32Array {
  const buffer = new Float32Array(this.bufferSize);
  const frequency = 440; // HARDCODED!
  for (let i = 0; i < buffer.length; i++) {
    buffer[i] = Math.sin((2 * Math.PI * frequency * i) / this.sampleRate) * 0.5;
  }
  return buffer;
}
```

**Result**: Pitch always ~440Hz, accuracy always 0%

### AFTER (Real Microphone):
```typescript
// ✅ NEW CODE
await ExpoAudioStream.startRecording({
  sampleRate: 44100,
  channels: 1,
  encoding: 'pcm_16bit',
  interval: 46,
  onAudioStream: async (event: AudioDataEvent) => {
    const pcmBuffer = this.convertAudioData(event.data); // Real audio!
    this.pitchCallback(pcmBuffer, this.sampleRate);
  }
});
```

**Result**: Pitch responds to real voice, accurate feedback

## 📈 Expected User Experience

### Exercise Flow:
1. **Select Exercise** → "5-Note Warm-Up"
2. **Tap Start** → Piano plays C4 reference note
3. **Sing "Ahhhh"** → Pitch visualizer shows detected pitch
4. **Match the note** → Visual feedback: "Perfect! Move to next note"
5. **Complete 5 notes** → Results screen: "87% accuracy - Great job!"

### Visual Feedback:
- **Green circle**: Singing in tune
- **Red circle**: Singing off-pitch
- **Pitch number updates**: 261.6 Hz, 329.6 Hz, etc.
- **Accuracy percentage**: 87%, 92%, etc.
