# PITCHPERFECT: $5-10/MONTH PRODUCT PLAN
## Making This Worth Paying For

---

## THE CRITICAL FIXES (DO FIRST)

### 1. PITCH DETECTION MUST FEEL GOOD ✅ IN PROGRESS

**Problems:**
- Dot jumping around too much → FIXED: Added smoothing
- Green zone too strict (±10 cents) → FIXED: Changed to ±20 cents
- Hold time too long (2 seconds) → FIXED: Reduced to 1.5 seconds

**Test Criteria:**
- [ ] User sings A4, stays roughly on pitch, dot stays relatively stable
- [ ] Green zone feels achievable (not frustrating)
- [ ] Success happens quickly enough to feel rewarding
- [ ] User wants to do "one more note"
