# Build Fix Summary - October 7, 2025

## Problem Identified

**Error**: `expo-audio-stream` package had Swift compilation errors
**Root Cause**: Missing `import Accelerate` framework in AudioUtils.swift
**Impact**: App would not build on iOS (simulator or device)

---

## Solution Applied

### Fix #1: Added Config Plugin
**File**: `app.json`
**Change**: Added `"@mykin-ai/expo-audio-stream"` to plugins array

```json
"plugins": [
  "expo-dev-client",
  "@mykin-ai/expo-audio-stream"
]
```

### Fix #2: Fixed Swift Import
**File**: `node_modules/@mykin-ai/expo-audio-stream/ios/AudioUtils.swift`
**Change**: Added missing Accelerate framework import

```swift
import AVFoundation
import ExpoModulesCore
import Accelerate  // ← Added this line
```

### Fix #3: Regenerated iOS Project
**Command**: `npx expo prebuild --platform ios --clean`
**Result**: Native iOS project regenerated with correct configuration

## Build Status

**Status**: ✅ BUILD SUCCESSFUL
**Verified**: iOS simulator build completed with 0 errors
**Ready**: App is ready for physical iPhone testing

## How to Build (For User)

### Prerequisites:
1. iPhone connected via USB
2. Xcode installed
3. Apple Developer account signed in to Xcode

### Option A: Build via Xcode (Recommended)
1. Open `ios/PitchPerfect.xcworkspace` in Xcode
2. Select your iPhone from the device dropdown
3. Click the Play button (▶️)
4. Wait 3-5 minutes for first build
5. App installs and launches automatically

### Option B: Build via Command Line
```bash
npx expo run:ios --device
```

## Known Issues Fixed

1. ✅ `vDSP_vgenp` not found → Fixed with `import Accelerate`
2. ✅ `vDSP_Stride` not found → Fixed with `import Accelerate`
3. ✅ `vDSP_Length` not found → Fixed with `import Accelerate`
4. ✅ PhaseScriptExecution failures → Fixed with config plugin
5. ✅ Device busy errors → Solved by using Xcode directly

## Testing Checklist

Once built successfully:

### Piano Playback Test:
- [ ] Launch app
- [ ] Tap "5-Note Warm-Up"
- [ ] Tap "Start Exercise"
- [ ] **Verify piano sound plays from speaker** (not earpiece)
- [ ] Sound should be clear and audible

### Pitch Detection Test:
- [ ] Grant microphone permission when prompted
- [ ] Sing "Ahhhh" during exercise
- [ ] **Verify detected pitch changes with your voice**
- [ ] Pitch should NOT be stuck at ~440Hz

### Complete Exercise Test:
- [ ] Complete all 5 notes
- [ ] Check results screen
- [ ] **Verify accuracy > 0%** (if sang correctly)
- [ ] Feedback should make sense

## What Was Changed in Codebase

### Core Changes:
1. **NativeAudioService.ts** - Replaced simulated audio with real-time capture
2. **app.json** - Added expo-audio-stream plugin
3. **AudioUtils.swift** - Fixed missing Accelerate import (in node_modules)

### Files Modified:
- `src/services/audio/NativeAudioService.ts` (complete refactor)
- `app.json` (added plugin)
- `node_modules/@mykin-ai/expo-audio-stream/ios/AudioUtils.swift` (bug fix)

---

## Important Note - Patches Created ✅

Both fixes have been saved as permanent patch files:
- ✅ `patches/@mykin-ai+expo-audio-stream+0.2.28.patch` - Accelerate import fix
- ✅ `patches/expo-dev-launcher+6.0.13.patch` - API compatibility fix
- ✅ `postinstall` script automatically applies patches after `npm install`
- ✅ **Safe to run `npm install` anytime** - patches will auto-apply

---

## Next Steps After Successful Build

1. **Test piano playback** - Verify speaker routing works
2. **Test pitch detection** - Verify real microphone input
3. **Test all 5 exercises** - Complete end-to-end flow
4. **Create patch file** - Make AudioUtils.swift fix permanent
5. **Document for App Store** - Prepare for submission

---

## Build Time Expectations

- **First build**: 3-5 minutes (full compilation)
- **Subsequent builds**: 30-60 seconds (incremental)
- **Clean build**: 3-5 minutes

---

## If Build Fails Again

1. **Check Xcode Errors** - Look for red text in build output
2. **Verify Accelerate import** - Make sure line 3 in AudioUtils.swift has it
3. **Clean build folder** - Product → Clean Build Folder in Xcode
4. **Restart Xcode** - Sometimes helps with signing issues
