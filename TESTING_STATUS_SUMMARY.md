## What Needs Manual Testing ⏳

Since I can't physically interact with the iOS Simulator (tapping, listening to audio), **YOU need to complete these tests manually**:

### Critical Tests (Must Complete)

1. **Piano Playback Test**
   - Tap "Start Exercise" in the simulator
   - Listen for piano playing C4, D4, E4, D4, C4
   - Verify audio is audible and clear

2. **Exercise Progression Test**
   - Verify app auto-advances through all 5 notes
   - Check timing is ~1 second per note
   - Confirm no manual tapping needed

3. **Results Screen Test**
   - Verify results screen appears after exercise
   - Check accuracy percentage shows
   - Verify "Try Again" button works

4. **All Exercises Test**
   - Run all 5 exercises one by one
   - Verify each plays correct notes
   - Check for any crashes or errors

---

## How to Test (Quick Start)

### Option 1: In the Simulator (Recommended)

1. **The iOS Simulator should already be open** with PitchPerfect running
   - If not visible, click the Simulator app icon in your Dock

2. **In the simulator**:
   - Scroll down to see "Start Exercise" button
   - Tap "Start Exercise"
   - **Listen** - you should hear piano notes

3. **What to expect**:
   - Piano plays C4 (1 second)
   - Pause (1 second)
   - Piano plays D4 (1 second)
   - Continues for E4, D4, C4
   - Shows results screen at end

### Option 2: Restart if Needed

If the app isn't responding:

```bash
# Restart app
xcrun simctl launch 36CD74EC-29A6-4A12-91BB-85C66DF8E7EB com.yourcompany.pitchperfect

# Or rebuild if Metro bundler stopped
npx expo run:ios
```

## Expected vs Actual

### What SHOULD Happen ✅

**When you tap "Start Exercise"**:
1. Piano plays C4 (middle C) for 1 second - **audible sound**
2. App waits 1 second (for user to sing)
3. Piano plays D4 for 1 second
4. App waits 1 second
5. Piano plays E4 for 1 second
6. App waits 1 second
7. Piano plays D4 for 1 second
8. App waits 1 second
9. Piano plays C4 for 1 second
10. App waits 1 second
11. Results screen appears showing ~80-90% accuracy

**Visual Indicators**:
- "Now Playing" section shows current note (C4, D4, E4, etc.)
- "Note X of 5" counter updates
- Detected note shows (will be simulated on simulator)

### What MIGHT Go Wrong ❌

**If you hear NO SOUND**:
- Possible cause: Piano samples not loaded correctly
- Check console logs for errors
- Try restarting Metro bundler

**If app crashes**:
- Possible cause: Memory issue with large AIFF files
- Check if all 37 samples loaded
- May need to optimize file sizes

**If exercise doesn't progress**:
- Possible cause: ExerciseEngine timing issue
- Check if tempo is set correctly
- Verify callbacks are triggering

## Console Logs to Monitor

### Open Terminal and Run:
```bash
xcrun simctl spawn 36CD74EC-29A6-4A12-91BB-85C66DF8E7EB log stream --predicate 'processImagePath contains "PitchPerfect"' --level debug
```

### Look For:
**Good Logs** (What you WANT to see):
```
🎹 NativeAudioService: Playing C4 for 1s
✅ Sound loaded successfully
📍 Note 1: C4
📍 Note 2: D4
🎉 Exercise completed!
```

**Bad Logs** (What indicates PROBLEMS):
```
❌ Failed to play C4
❌ No sample for C4
⚠️ Sound loading failed
ERROR: ...
```

---

## Quick Troubleshooting

### Problem: No Sound
**Solution**:
1. Check Mac volume is up
2. Check Simulator audio is enabled (Simulator → I/O → Audio Input)
3. Restart app with Metro bundler

### Problem: App Crashes
**Solution**:
1. Check console logs for error
2. Restart Metro bundler: `npx expo start --ios`
3. Rebuild if needed: `npx expo run:ios`

### Problem: Wrong Notes Playing
**Solution**:
1. Check exercise definition in `src/data/exercises/scales.ts`
2. Verify note-to-file mapping in NativeAudioService
3. Test individual piano sample

## Documentation Created

1. **iOS_TESTING_GUIDE.md** - Comprehensive testing manual
2. **PIANO_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md** - Technical implementation details
3. **TESTING_STATUS_SUMMARY.md** - This document (quick reference)
4. **IOS_BUILD_SUCCESS.md** - Build process documentation

---

## Next Steps Based on Test Results

### If Piano Works ✅
**Immediate**:
1. ✅ Document success with screenshots
2. ✅ Note any audio quality issues
3. ✅ Test all 5 exercises

**Short-term** (Next Session):
4. Test on real iPhone device (with microphone)
5. Implement real-time pitch detection
6. Optimize audio file sizes (AIFF → MP3)

**Medium-term** (This Week):
7. Create TestFlight build
8. Invite 5-10 beta testers
9. Collect feedback
10. Iterate based on user input

### If Piano Doesn't Work ❌
**Immediate**:
1. ❌ Check console logs for specific error
2. ❌ Verify piano sample paths are correct
3. ❌ Test single note loading in isolation

**Debug Steps**:
```typescript
// Test in NativeAudioService.ts
const testPiano = async () => {
  const { sound } = await Audio.Sound.createAsync(
    require('../../../assets/audio/piano/C4.aiff')
  );
  await sound.playAsync();
  console.log('✅ C4 played successfully');
};
```

4. Fix issues found
5. Rebuild app
6. Retest

## Current Blockers

### Blocker #1: Manual Testing Required ⏳
**Issue**: I cannot physically tap the simulator or hear audio
**Owner**: YOU (the user)
**Next Action**: Follow iOS_TESTING_GUIDE.md to test manually
**ETA**: 15-30 minutes

### Blocker #2: Real Device Testing ⏳
**Issue**: iOS Simulator has no microphone (pitch detection can't be tested)
**Owner**: YOU (need Apple Developer account + iPhone)
**Next Action**: Set up device provisioning, test on real iPhone
**ETA**: 1-2 hours (including setup)

### Blocker #3: Pitch Detection Implementation ⏳
**Issue**: Real-time PCM extraction not yet implemented
**Owner**: Development (me, in next session)
**Next Action**: Implement expo-av Recording → PCM conversion
**ETA**: 4-6 hours of development
