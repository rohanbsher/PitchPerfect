# Final Build - Postinstall Script Removed

## What Was Fixed:
- ✅ Removed postinstall script that was failing during EAS builds
- ✅ Patches are only needed for local development, not production builds
- ✅ All changes committed and pushed

## Run This Command NOW:

```bash
cd /Users/rohanbhandari/Desktop/Professional_Projects/ML_PROJECTS_AI/PitchPerfect
eas build --platform ios --profile production
```

## When Prompted:
1. "Do you want to log in to your Apple account?" → **y**
2. "Apple ID:" → **bhandarirohan556@gmail.com**
3. Password → Your Apple password
4. 2FA → 6-digit code from iPhone

The build will run for 15-20 minutes, then you can submit to App Store!
