## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Platform Abstraction Pattern

```typescript
// User opens app
App.tsx
  └─> ExerciseScreenComplete
        └─> AudioServiceFactory.create()
              ├─> Platform.OS === 'web' → WebAudioService
              │     └─> Web Audio API + Tone.js
              │
              └─> Platform.OS === 'ios' → NativeAudioService
                    └─> Expo AV (audio recording/playback)

// Both services implement IAudioService
interface IAudioService {
  initialize(): Promise<void>;
  requestPermissions(): Promise<boolean>;
  startMicrophoneCapture(callback): Promise<void>;
  stopMicrophoneCapture(): Promise<void>;
  playNote(noteName, duration): Promise<void>;
  dispose(): void;
  getSampleRate(): number;
}
```

### Exercise Flow Architecture

```
User selects exercise (5-Note Warmup or C Major Scale)
  ↓
ExerciseEngineV2.start()
  ├─> Initialize audio session
  ├─> Start microphone capture
  └─> For each note in exercise:
        1. Play piano note (using IAudioService.playNote())
        2. Listen for user singing (real-time pitch detection)
        3. Track accuracy and confidence
        4. Auto-advance to next note
  ↓
ExerciseEngineV2.complete()
  ├─> Calculate overall accuracy
  ├─> Analyze strengths/improvements
  └─> Display results screen
```

## 🐛 Bugs Fixed

### Critical Bug #1: Pitch Detection Display
**Issue**: Detected note not displaying (showed as "—")
**Root Cause**: Property name mismatch (`result.noteName` vs `result.note`)
**Fix**: Changed `result.noteName` → `result.note` in ExerciseTestScreenV2.tsx:90
**Impact**: Unblocked core user value

---

## 🔧 Technical Decisions

### Why Platform Abstraction?
**Problem**: Web Audio API doesn't work on iOS
**Solution**: IAudioService interface with platform-specific implementations
**Benefit**: Write once, works everywhere

### Why Expo AV Instead of Custom Native Module?
**Pros**:
- Official Expo package
- Works on iOS/Android/Web
- Maintained and supported
- No native code required (for MVP)

**Cons**:
- Real-time PCM extraction requires workaround
- No audio synthesis (need pre-recorded samples)

**Decision**: Use Expo AV for MVP, consider custom module if needed

### Why YIN Algorithm?
**Alternatives Considered**: Autocorrelation, FFT Peak Detection, Harmonic Product Spectrum

**Why YIN Wins**:
- ✅ Pure JavaScript (works on all platforms)
- ✅ Highly accurate for human voice
- ✅ No dependencies
- ✅ Well-documented algorithm
- ✅ Fast enough for real-time (<10ms per buffer)

## 🚧 Remaining Work for iOS

### High Priority (MVP Blockers)

1. **Piano Sample Assets** (2 hours)
   - Download 37 MP3 files (C3-C6)
   - Add to `/assets/audio/piano/`
   - Update NativeAudioService.noteSamples mapping

2. **Real-Time PCM Extraction** (4-6 hours)
   - Current: NativeAudioService uses simulated data
   - Options:
     - A) Periodic Expo AV recording snapshots (simple, 100ms latency)
     - B) Custom native module (complex, <50ms latency)
     - C) Third-party package (if compatible)
   - Recommended: Option A for MVP

3. **iOS Simulator Testing** (1 hour)
   - Build: `npx expo run:ios`
   - Test microphone capture
   - Verify pitch detection
   - Test exercise flow

4. **iOS Device Testing** (1 hour)
   - Deploy to real iPhone (simulator has no microphone)
   - Test with real singing
   - Measure latency
   - Collect user feedback

### Medium Priority (Nice to Have)

5. **Audio Latency Optimization** (3-4 hours)
   - Target: <100ms end-to-end on iOS
   - Reduce buffer size if needed
   - Optimize YIN algorithm
   - Use lower sample rate (22050 Hz)

6. **Additional Exercises** (2 hours per exercise)
   - Interval training
   - Arpeggio exercises
   - Custom scales

7. **Progress Tracking** (4-6 hours)
   - Save exercise history
   - Show improvement over time
   - Achievements/badges

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes

### Technical Insights
1. **Web Audio API limitations**: Cannot use on React Native
2. **Expo AV capabilities**: Good for recording/playback, limited for real-time analysis
3. **YIN algorithm**: Excellent for voice, requires tuning for noisy environments
4. **React Native Platform**: Simple but powerful for cross-platform detection

### Architecture Lessons
1. **Abstraction early**: Designing IAudioService upfront saved refactoring time
2. **Test on target platform**: Web working ≠ iOS working
3. **User value first**: Core pitch detection more important than fancy features
