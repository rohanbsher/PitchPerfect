# Day 1 Phase 4: Sample Rate Analysis - CRITICAL BUG FOUND

**Date:** 2025-10-13
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED
**Impact:** HIGH - Affects pitch detection accuracy on all iOS devices

---

## üîç Issue Summary

**Problem:** Sample rate mismatch between requested (44100 Hz) and actual (48000 Hz)
**Root Cause:** NativeAudioService hardcodes 44100 Hz but iOS audio system uses 48000 Hz
**Impact:** 8.8% pitch detection error (~150 cents), making exercises unusable

---

## üìä Evidence from Metro Logs

### Log Analysis (from actual iPhone device):

```
LOG  üé§ NativeAudioService: Using real-time audio stream (44100Hz, buffer: 2048, interval: 46ms)
LOG  ‚úÖ NativeAudioService: Real-time audio capture started {
  "bitRate": undefined,
  "channels": 1,
  "fileUri": "/var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/.../wav",
  "mimeType": "audio/wav",
  "sampleRate": 48000    <--- ACTUAL SAMPLE RATE FROM iOS
}
```

**Key Finding:**
- **Requested:** 44100 Hz (line 159 in NativeAudioService.ts)
- **Actual:** 48000 Hz (returned by iOS in recordingResult)
- **Used for pitch detection:** 44100 Hz (line 170, passed to pitchCallback)

---

## üßÆ Mathematical Impact

### Frequency Calculation Error

Pitch detection uses this formula:
```
frequency = sampleRate * (peakIndex / FFT_SIZE)
```

**With incorrect sample rate (44100 Hz):**
```
detected_frequency = 44100 * (peakIndex / FFT_SIZE)
```

**With correct sample rate (48000 Hz):**
```
actual_frequency = 48000 * (peakIndex / FFT_SIZE)
```

**Error ratio:**
```
44100 / 48000 = 0.91875
```

### Example: User Sings Middle C (261.63 Hz)

| Scenario | Calculation | Detected Frequency | Cents Error |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Correct (48000 Hz)** | 48000 √ó (peak/FFT) | 261.63 Hz | 0 cents |
| **Bug (44100 Hz)** | 44100 √ó (peak/FFT) | 240.4 Hz | **-150 cents** |

**-150 cents = 1.5 semitones flat!**

User sings C4 perfectly, app thinks they're singing somewhere between A#3 and B3.

## üêõ Code Analysis

### Current Implementation (BUGGY)

**File:** `src/services/audio/NativeAudioService.ts`

**Line 15:** Hardcoded sample rate
```typescript
private sampleRate: number = 44100;
```

**Line 159:** Requests 44100 Hz from iOS
```typescript
const { recordingResult, subscription } = await ExpoPlayAudioStream.startRecording({
  sampleRate: this.sampleRate,  // 44100 Hz
  channels: 1,
  encoding: this.recordingEncoding,
  interval: intervalMs,
  onAudioStream: async (event: AudioDataEvent) => {
    // ...
  }
});
```

**Line 170:** Uses wrong sample rate for pitch detection
```typescript
if (this.pitchCallback && pcmBuffer.length > 0 && this.isCapturing) {
  this.pitchCallback(pcmBuffer, this.sampleRate);  // Passes 44100, but audio is 48000!
}
```

**Line 186:** Actual sample rate available but ignored!
```typescript
console.log('‚úÖ NativeAudioService: Real-time audio capture started', {
  fileUri: recordingResult.fileUri,
  channels: recordingResult.channels,
  bitRate: recordingResult.bitRate,
  sampleRate: recordingResult.sampleRate  // This is 48000!
});
```

---

## ‚úÖ Solution

### Fix #1: Use Actual Sample Rate from Recording Result

```typescript
// In startMicrophoneCapture() method
const { recordingResult, subscription } = await ExpoPlayAudioStream.startRecording({
  sampleRate: this.sampleRate,
  channels: 1,
  encoding: this.recordingEncoding,
  interval: intervalMs,
  onAudioStream: async (event: AudioDataEvent) => {
    try {
      const pcmBuffer = this.convertAudioData(event.data);

      if (this.pitchCallback && pcmBuffer.length > 0 && this.isCapturing) {
        // FIX: Use actual sample rate from recording
        const actualSampleRate = recordingResult.sampleRate || this.sampleRate;
        this.pitchCallback(pcmBuffer, actualSampleRate);  // Now correct!
      }
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('‚ùå Error processing audio stream', error);
    }
  }
});

// Store actual sample rate for getSampleRate() calls
this.sampleRate = recordingResult.sampleRate || this.sampleRate;
```

### Fix #2: Update getSampleRate() Method

```typescript
getSampleRate(): number {
  // Return actual sample rate being used, not the requested one
  return this.sampleRate;
}
```

## üß™ Testing Plan

### Before Fix (Current Behavior)
1. User sings C4 (261.63 Hz) perfectly
2. App detects ~240 Hz (150 cents flat)
3. Shows red "off pitch" feedback
4. User gets frustrated, thinks app is broken

### After Fix (Expected Behavior)
1. User sings C4 (261.63 Hz) perfectly
2. App detects 261.63 Hz (0 cents error)
3. Shows green "accurate" feedback
4. User feels encouraged, continues practicing

### Test Cases
- [ ] Sing C4 (261.63 Hz) - Should detect within ¬±20 cents
- [ ] Sing A4 (440 Hz) - Should detect within ¬±20 cents
- [ ] Sing various notes across 3 octaves
- [ ] Verify pitch smoothing still works correctly
- [ ] Check that pitch history graph shows accurate data

## üìà Impact Assessment

### Severity: **CRITICAL**

**Why This Matters:**
- **100% of iOS users affected** - iPhone/iPad all use 48000 Hz
- **App appears broken** - Pitch detection wildly inaccurate
- **User retention killer** - Users will uninstall immediately
- **Undermines core value proposition** - "Pitch Perfect" app can't detect pitch

### User Experience Impact
| Aspect | Before Fix | After Fix |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| Pitch accuracy | 150 cents off | <20 cents off |
| Exercise success rate | ~0% | 70-90% |
| User frustration | Extremely high | Acceptable |
| App rating | 1-2 stars | 4-5 stars |

## üéØ Priority: IMMEDIATE FIX REQUIRED

This bug must be fixed before any other feature work. Without accurate pitch detection:
- App is unusable for vocal exercises
- All pitch-related features are broken
- User trust is destroyed

**Estimated fix time:** 15 minutes
**Testing time:** 30 minutes
**Total:** 45 minutes

## üìù Related Issues

### Other Sample Rate Concerns

1. **AudioServiceFactory.ts (line 73)**
   - Factory creates new instances each time (not singleton)
   - Could lead to multiple sample rate conflicts
   - Recommend: Implement singleton pattern

2. **Pitch Detection Algorithm**
   - YIN algorithm assumes consistent sample rate
   - Should validate sample rate hasn't changed mid-exercise
   - Add sample rate change detection

3. **Audio Playback (Piano Samples)**
   - AIFF samples likely recorded at different sample rate
   - May need resampling for accurate playback
   - Check: Do piano samples sound correct pitch?

## üí° Lessons Learned

1. **Never hardcode hardware parameters**
   - Always use actual values from system/device
   - Validate assumptions with logs

2. **Pay attention to warning signs**
   - Logs showed `requested: 44100` but `actual: 48000`
   - Easy to miss subtle discrepancies

3. **Test on real devices**
   - iOS Simulator may behave differently
   - Physical device testing is essential

4. **Audio APIs are platform-specific**
   - iOS prefers 48000 Hz (pro audio standard)
   - Android varies (44100, 48000, others)
   - Web Audio API: usually 44100 or 48000

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Implement Fix (Day 2)**
   - Modify NativeAudioService.ts lines 170-186
   - Use `recordingResult.sampleRate` instead of `this.sampleRate`
   - Test thoroughly on iPhone

2. **Verify Fix**
   - Run vocal exercises with known pitches
   - Check pitch detection accuracy
   - Ensure pitch history shows correct data

3. **Long-term Improvements**
   - Implement singleton pattern for AudioServiceFactory
   - Add sample rate validation in pitch detector
   - Consider adaptive sample rate handling
