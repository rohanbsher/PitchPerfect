  - Visual timeline component with color-coded bars
  - Last 30 pitch readings displayed
  - Green (>90%), Yellow (70-90%), Red (<70%) color coding
  - Opacity gradient (recent readings more visible)
  - Legend and empty state

- ✅ Integrated into `src/screens/ExerciseScreenComplete.tsx`
  - Auto-tracks pitch during exercises (confidence > 0.5)
  - Clears history on new exercise start
  - Displays in results screen for vocal exercises

**Git Commit:** `0384276` - feat: Add pitch history graph with analytics

---

### Phase 3: Session Stats Cards Extraction ✅ (60 min)

**Goal:** Extract session statistics display from PitchPerfectPro

**Completed:**
- ✅ Created `src/components/analytics/SessionStatsCards.tsx` (188 lines)
  - 3 primary stat cards (Accuracy %, Notes Detected, Best Match)
  - Extended stats row (Duration, Average, Most Common Note)
  - iOS-inspired frosted glass card design
  - Empty state handling

- ✅ Integrated into `src/screens/ExerciseScreenComplete.tsx`
  - Displays below pitch history graph
  - Shows key performance metrics
  - Responsive card layout

**Key Metrics:**
1. **Accuracy %** - Percentage of excellent readings (>90%)
2. **Notes Detected** - Total pitch readings captured
3. **Best Match** - Highest accuracy achieved
4. **Duration** - Exercise time in seconds
5. **Average Accuracy** - Mean across all readings
6. **Most Common Note** - Most frequently detected

**Benefits:**
- Quick performance overview
- Motivational metrics (best match highlights success)
- Professional look matching top vocal apps
- Helps users track consistency

**Git Commit:** `27a708d` - feat: Add session stats cards to results screen

---

### Phase 4: Sample Rate Analysis ✅ (30 min)

**Goal:** Investigate sample rate handling and verify accuracy

**Completed:**
- ✅ Analyzed Metro logs from physical iPhone
- ✅ Identified critical bug in NativeAudioService.ts
- ✅ Calculated mathematical impact (-150 cents error)
- ✅ Documented comprehensive analysis
- ✅ Proposed solution with implementation plan

**Critical Finding:**
- **Bug:** Sample rate mismatch (requested 44100 Hz, actual 48000 Hz)
- **Impact:** 150 cents pitch error (1.5 semitones flat!)
- **Severity:** CRITICAL - 100% of iOS users affected
- **User Experience:** App appears broken, exercises impossible to pass

**Evidence from Logs:**
```
Requested: 44100 Hz
Actual:    48000 Hz
Used:      44100 Hz  <-- BUG!
```

**Example Impact:**
- User sings C4 (261.63 Hz) perfectly
- App detects ~240 Hz (between A#3 and B3)
- Shows "off pitch" when user is accurate
- User gets frustrated and uninstalls

**Solution Proposed:**
```typescript
// FIX: Use actual sample rate from recording result
const actualSampleRate = recordingResult.sampleRate || this.sampleRate;
this.pitchCallback(pcmBuffer, actualSampleRate);
```

**Git Commit:** `f9f68fd` - docs: Critical sample rate bug analysis (Day 1 Phase 4)

## 💡 Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
- ✅ Systematic approach (4 phases) kept work organized
- ✅ Reading source files first prevented mistakes
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation will help future work
- ✅ Discovering bug early saves production disasters

### What to Improve
- 🔍 Run exercises on physical device earlier
- 🔍 Add automated tests for critical paths
- 🔍 Validate assumptions with logs more frequently

### Key Insight
> "Never trust hardcoded audio parameters. Always use actual values from the system."

The sample rate bug shows why testing on real devices is essential. iOS Simulator might not catch audio-specific issues.
