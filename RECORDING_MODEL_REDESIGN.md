# PITCHPERFECT: RECORDING MODEL REDESIGN

## THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM

**What I Built**: Continuous real-time pitch visualization
- User sings continuously
- Dot moves around showing pitch in real-time
- Must hold pitch steady for 1.5 seconds
- Visual feedback is instant but overwhelming

**What You Actually Want**: Recording/Playback model
- Play reference note
- User sings it back (3-5 seconds)
- App records and analyzes
- Shows result: "85% accurate - Great job!"
- Tracks progress over time

**Why Recording Model is Better**:
1. **Less Stressful**: User doesn't watch moving dot while singing
2. **More Natural**: Sing freely, then see result (like vocal coach feedback)
3. **Clearer Grading**: "You got 85%" vs "stay in green zone"
4. **Better Progress Tracking**: Compare recordings over time
5. **More Fun**: Immediate gratification when you see your score

## WHY THIS FEELS BETTER

### 1. **Separation of Concerns**
- **While Singing**: Focus on singing (no visual distraction)
- **After Singing**: See result and learn

### 2. **Clear Feedback**
- **Before**: "Am I in the green? Why is it yellow? Is this good enough?"
- **After**: "85% - Great!" (unambiguous)

### 3. **Natural Flow**
- Matches how vocal coaches work: Demonstrate → Student tries → Coach gives feedback
- Not: Coach watches in real-time and tells you to adjust mid-phrase

### 4. **Progress Tracking Makes Sense**
- Day 1: C4 = 65%
- Day 7: C4 = 78%
- Day 30: C4 = 92%
- Can show graph of improvement

### 5. **Gamification Works Better**
- Stars (1-3 based on accuracy)
- Badges ("Hit 90%+ on 5 notes in a row")
- Streak tracking makes sense
- Leaderboard potential

## TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### Phase 1: Recording Mechanism

**Use MediaRecorder API** (already have microphone access):

```typescript
// 1. Start recording
const mediaRecorder = new MediaRecorder(stream);
const chunks: Blob[] = [];

mediaRecorder.ondataavailable = (e) => {
  chunks.push(e.data);
};

mediaRecorder.onstop = async () => {
  const audioBlob = new Blob(chunks, { type: 'audio/webm' });
  await analyzeRecording(audioBlob);
};

// 2. Record for 3 seconds
mediaRecorder.start();
setTimeout(() => {
  mediaRecorder.stop();
}, 3000);
```

### Phase 2: Analysis

**Analyze recorded audio for pitch accuracy**:

```typescript
async function analyzeRecording(audioBlob: Blob): Promise<AnalysisResult> {
  // 1. Convert blob to audio buffer
  const arrayBuffer = await audioBlob.arrayBuffer();
  const audioBuffer = await audioContext.decodeAudioData(arrayBuffer);

  // 2. Extract samples
  const samples = audioBuffer.getChannelData(0);

  // 3. Detect pitch at 100ms intervals
  const pitchReadings: number[] = [];
  const windowSize = 2048;
  const hopSize = 4410; // 100ms at 44.1kHz

  for (let i = 0; i < samples.length - windowSize; i += hopSize) {
    const window = samples.slice(i, i + windowSize);
    const pitch = pitchDetector.detectPitch(window);

    if (pitch && pitch.confidence > 0.5) {
      const cents = calculateCentsOff(pitch.frequency, targetFrequency);
      pitchReadings.push(Math.abs(cents));
    }
  }

  // 4. Calculate accuracy
  // Good reading = within ±20 cents
  const goodReadings = pitchReadings.filter(cents => cents <= 20).length;
  const accuracy = (goodReadings / pitchReadings.length) * 100;

  // 5. Calculate star rating
  let stars = 1;
  if (accuracy >= 70) stars = 2;
  if (accuracy >= 85) stars = 3;

  return {
    accuracy: Math.round(accuracy),
    stars,
    averageCentsOff: pitchReadings.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0) / pitchReadings.length,
    audioBlob, // For playback
  };
}
```

### Phase 3: Star Rating

**Simple and Clear**:
- ⭐ (1 star): 50-69% accuracy - "Keep practicing!"
- ⭐⭐ (2 stars): 70-84% accuracy - "Good job!"
- ⭐⭐⭐ (3 stars): 85-100% accuracy - "Excellent!"

### Phase 4: Progress Tracking

**Store in localStorage (free) or cloud (paid)**:

```typescript
interface Attempt {
  noteId: string;      // "C4"
  frequency: number;   // 261.63
  accuracy: number;    // 85
  stars: number;       // 3
  timestamp: number;   // Date.now()
  audioBlob?: Blob;    // Optional: store recording
}

interface Progress {
  attempts: Attempt[];
  streak: number;          // Days in a row
  totalNotes: number;      // Total attempts
  averageAccuracy: number; // Rolling average
}
```

**Show Progress**:
```
YOUR PROGRESS

This Week: 42 notes, 78% avg accuracy
Last Week: 35 notes, 72% avg accuracy

📈 You improved 6% this week!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
C4: ⭐⭐⭐ (92%) - Personal best!
D4: ⭐⭐ (78%)
E4: ⭐⭐⭐ (88%)
F4: ⭐ (65%) - Need more practice
```

## KEY INSIGHTS

### Why Recording > Real-time

1. **Cognitive Load**
   - Real-time: Sing + watch + adjust simultaneously
   - Recording: Just sing (then review)

2. **Emotional Experience**
   - Real-time: Anxiety (am I doing it right?)
   - Recording: Excitement (how did I do?)

3. **Learning Effectiveness**
   - Real-time: Constant correction (overwhelming)
   - Recording: Clear feedback (actionable)

4. **Progress Clarity**
   - Real-time: Hard to remember how you did
   - Recording: Permanent record (compare over time)

5. **Gamification**
   - Real-time: Binary (held vs didn't hold)
   - Recording: Score (65% → 78% → 92% progression)

### What Makes Users Pay

**Not Paying For**: Pitch detection (that's commodity)

**Paying For**:
1. **Seeing improvement** - "I was 65%, now I'm 85%"
2. **Not losing progress** - "My 30-day streak is safe"
3. **Removing friction** - "I can practice as much as I want"
4. **Concrete proof** - "Listen to me 30 days ago vs now"

**The Moment They Upgrade**:
> "I've done this 7 days in a row, hit my limit today, but I want to keep going. I don't want to break my streak. I can see I'm improving. $7 is worth not losing this."

---

## COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE

### vs Yousician ($10/month)
- **Simpler**: One thing (pitch) vs trying to teach everything
- **Cheaper**: $7 vs $10
- **Faster**: 5 minutes vs 30-minute lessons
- **Message**: "Master pitch in 5 minutes a day"

### vs Vanido ($8/month)
- **Better Feedback**: Recording model vs real-time confusion
- **Clearer Progress**: Percentage scores vs vague indicators
- **More Fun**: Stars and gamification
- **Message**: "See exactly how much you improve"

### vs Vocal Coach ($50-100/lesson)
- **Price**: $7/month vs $200+/month
- **Convenience**: Anytime vs scheduled
- **Consistency**: Daily practice vs weekly lessons
- **Message**: "Daily practice for the price of a coffee"

---

## WHAT USERS WILL SAY

**After First Recording**:
> "Oh! I got 72% - that's actually really clear feedback. Let me try again."

**After First 3-Star**:
> "Yes! I got 3 stars! That felt amazing. One more note..."

**After One Week**:
> "I've used this 7 days in a row. My average went from 68% to 76%. It's working!"

**When Hitting Paywall**:
> "Ugh, only 5 recordings today? But I want to practice more... and I don't want to lose my streak... *clicks upgrade*"

**After One Month Paid**:
> "I just listened to my Day 1 recording vs today. I sound SO much better. Worth every penny."

---

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Validate Concept** (Today)
   - Create this TODO and get user approval
   - Confirm recording model is the right approach
   - Agree on design direction

2. **Start Building** (Tomorrow)
   - Implement MediaRecorder API
   - Build basic recording flow
   - Test audio capture and playback

3. **Iterate Fast** (This Week)
   - Get recording → analysis → results working
   - Test with real singing
   - Refine accuracy calculation

4. **Ship MVP** (4-5 weeks)
   - Core recording flow
   - Basic progress tracking
   - Free/paid tiers
   - Launch to first users

---

## THE BOTTOM LINE

**Current App**: Real-time pitch visualization (technically works, but UX is wrong)

**New App**: Record → Analyze → Grade → Track (matches what users actually want)

**Why This Works**:
- Simpler to understand
- Less stressful to use
- Clearer feedback
- Better progress tracking
- More fun (gamification)
- Easier to monetize

**Goal**: Build something people use daily and happily pay $7/month for.

**Timeline**: 4-5 weeks to MVP launch.
