# PitchPerfect - App Store Readiness Report
**Date:** October 28, 2025
**Current Status:** 80% Ready for App Store
**Estimated Time to Launch:** 2-3 weeks

---

## Executive Summary

PitchPerfect has made **substantial progress** toward App Store launch. The app is technically sound with all core features implemented, including real-time pitch detection, 11 vocal exercises, and a polished UX. The remaining work is primarily **administrative** (Apple Developer account, App Store Connect setup) and **validation** (real device testing, screenshots).

**Key Achievement:** Real-time pitch detection is **fully implemented** and working with actual microphone input (not simulated data). This was the critical blocker from October 5th and has been resolved.
