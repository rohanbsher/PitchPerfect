# SECURITY ⚠️ CRITICAL
# ==================================================

# ⚠️ WARNING: If you've EVER committed .env with your real API key:
#    1. ROTATE your API key IMMEDIATELY at https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys
#    2. Delete the old key to prevent unauthorized usage
#    3. Never commit .env files again (check .gitignore)
#    4. For production: Use a backend proxy, NOT client-side API calls

# IMPORTANT: Never commit your .env file to git
# The .env file should be in .gitignore
# Only share your API key through secure channels (never Slack/email)
# Rotate your API key if it's ever exposed in commits or logs
# Consider using a backend service to proxy Anthropic API calls

# ==================================================
# TROUBLESHOOTING
# ==================================================

# If AI Coach isn't working:
# 1. Check that .env file exists (not .env.example)
# 2. Verify API key is correct (no extra spaces)
# 3. Restart Metro bundler completely
# 4. Check console for error messages
# 5. Verify you have internet connection
