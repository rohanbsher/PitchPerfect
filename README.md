# PitchPerfect - Musical Pitch Detection & Training App

An advanced, real-time pitch detection and musical training application built with React Native Expo. Perfect for musicians learning to sing, practice intervals, and improve their pitch accuracy.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Real-time Pitch Detection**: Uses the YIN algorithm for accurate pitch detection with <10ms latency
- **Multiple Visualization Modes**:
  - Line graph for pitch tracking over time
  - Musical staff notation
  - Interactive piano keyboard
- **Musical Exercises**: Pre-built exercises for scales, intervals, and arpeggios
- **Gamification**: Streak tracking, achievements, and progress monitoring
- **Recording & Playback**: Record performances with pitch overlay analysis

### Technical Highlights
- **YIN Pitch Detection Algorithm**: Industry-standard algorithm with high accuracy
- **Low Latency**: Optimized for real-time feedback (<10ms)
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on iOS, Android, and Web
- **Visual Feedback**: Color-coded accuracy indicators (green = perfect, yellow = close, red = off)
- **Haptic Feedback**: Physical feedback when hitting correct notes

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v20.5.0 or higher)
- Expo CLI
- iOS Simulator (Mac) or Android Emulator

### Key Technologies
- **React Native Expo**: Cross-platform mobile framework
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development
- **React Native Skia**: High-performance graphics rendering
- **Expo AV**: Audio recording and playback
- **React Native Reanimated**: Smooth animations

## YIN Pitch Detection Algorithm

The app uses the YIN algorithm for pitch detection, which provides:
- High accuracy for monophonic sources
- Robustness against noise
- Low computational complexity
- Real-time performance

### Algorithm Steps:
1. **Difference Function**: Calculate autocorrelation
2. **Cumulative Mean Normalization**: Normalize the difference function
3. **Absolute Threshold**: Find the first minimum below threshold
4. **Parabolic Interpolation**: Refine the pitch estimate

## Musical Exercises

### Available Exercises:
- **C Major Scale**: Practice ascending and descending scales
- **Intervals - Thirds**: Practice singing thirds in C Major
- **Intervals - Fifths**: Practice perfect fifths
- **C Major Arpeggio**: Practice triadic arpeggios
- **Chromatic Scale**: Advanced pitch accuracy training
- **Octave Jumps**: Practice large interval leaps

### Difficulty Levels:
- **Beginner**: Simple scales and small intervals
- **Intermediate**: Arpeggios and larger intervals
- **Advanced**: Chromatic scales and octave jumps

## Performance Optimization

### Mobile Optimization:
- 1024 sample buffer size for optimal latency/accuracy balance
- 44.1kHz sample rate
- Single-channel (mono) recording
- Native audio processing for low latency

### Web Optimization (Coming Soon):
- WebAssembly for pitch detection
- AudioWorklet for thread-isolated processing
- WebGL-accelerated visualizations

## Deployment & Distribution

### iOS App Store Deployment

PitchPerfect is production-ready and configured for iOS App Store submission.

**Quick Start Deployment:**

```bash
# 1. Install EAS CLI
npm install -g eas-cli

eas login

# 3. Initialize EAS project
eas init

# 4. Update configuration files with your details:
# - eas.json (Apple ID, Team ID)
# - app.json (EAS project ID, owner)

# 5. Build for App Store
eas build --platform ios --profile production

# 6. Submit to App Store
eas submit --platform ios --profile production
```

**Detailed Instructions:**
