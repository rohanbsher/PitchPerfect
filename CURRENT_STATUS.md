# CURRENT STATUS - PitchPerfect

**Date**: 2025-10-01
**Session**: Visual Pitch Scale Implementation
**Status**: ✅ Ready for Testing

---

## 📍 WHERE WE ARE NOW

### Current Build:
- **URL**: http://localhost:8082
- **Status**: Running and bundled
- **Screen**: ExerciseTestScreen with Visual Pitch Scale

---

## ✅ WHAT'S WORKING

### 1. Hands-Free Auto-Progression ✅
- Press START once
- Notes play automatically every ~2-3 seconds
- No button presses needed during exercise
- Results show at end

**User Feedback**: "It's much, much, much better"

### 2. Visual Pitch Scale ✅ NEW!
- Vertical scale showing all exercise notes
- Animated dot showing current pitch
- Dot glides smoothly up/down as you sing
- Color coding:
  - **GREEN**: Accurate (within ±20 cents)
  - **YELLOW**: Close (±20-50 cents)
  - **RED**: Off (>50 cents)
- Target note highlighted with white glowing line
- Real-time frequency display

**User Request**: "I wanna see a scale and my pitch whether it is gliding up or down on a scale instead of just numbers"
**Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED

### 3. Piano Sound Quality ✅
- Tone.js Salamander Grand Piano samples
- Pleasant, warm sound (not harsh/electronic)
- Natural attack and release

### 4. Pitch Detection Accuracy ✅
- YIN algorithm with actual sample rate
- Fixed C4 showing as B4 issue
- Confidence-based filtering

---

## 🎯 WHAT NEEDS TESTING

### Critical Tests:
1. **Visual Scale Display** - Does it show correctly?
2. **Pitch Dot Movement** - Does it glide smoothly?
3. **Color Coding** - Green/yellow/red working?
4. **Sharp/Flat Detection** - Dot moves up/down correctly?
5. **Animation Quality** - Smooth or jumpy?
6. **UX Improvement** - Better than numbers?

### The Ultimate Question:
> "Can you practice vocals by watching the pitch scale, adjusting your voice to hit the green zone, without reading any text?"

**If YES**: Feature is successful ✅
**If NO**: Need to iterate ❌

## 📋 NEXT STEPS

### Immediate (Now):
1. **Follow STEP_BY_STEP_TESTING_GUIDE.md**
2. Open http://localhost:8082
3. Test all 20 test cases
4. Document bugs in testing guide

### If Tests Pass:
1. Move to Week 2 tasks:
   - Build full UI (ExerciseLibrary, ActiveExercise, Results screens)
   - Add more exercises (12 major scales, intervals, arpeggios)
   - Add tempo control and key transposition
   - Deploy to Vercel

### If Tests Fail:
1. Fix bugs based on severity
2. Re-test critical features
3. Iterate until working

## 📊 FEATURE COMPARISON

| Feature | Before | After |
|---------|--------|-------|
| **Feedback Type** | Numbers (85%, 341¢) | Visual scale with dot |
| **Pitch Direction** | Not visible | See dot glide up/down |
| **Sharp/Flat** | Have to calculate | Dot above/below line |
| **Accuracy** | Read percentage | Green/yellow/red color |
| **UX** | Technical, slow | Intuitive, instant |

## 🎨 VISUAL SCALE FEATURES

### What You'll See:

```
Note 3 of 9

┌────────────────────────────┐
│                            │
│  G4 ─────────   392 Hz     │
│                            │
│  F4 ─────────✨ 349 Hz     │ ← Target (glowing)
│        ●                   │ ← Your pitch (green dot)
│  E4 ─────────   330 Hz     │
│                            │
│  D4 ─────────   294 Hz     │
│                            │
│  C4 ─────────   262 Hz     │
│                            │
└────────────────────────────┘
```

### How It Works:
1. **Target note** has white glowing line
2. **Your pitch** shows as colored dot
3. **Dot moves up** when you sing sharp
4. **Dot moves down** when you sing flat
5. **Dot turns green** when you hit target
6. **Smooth animations** (60fps, spring-based)

## 📁 KEY FILES

### New Files Created:
1. `/src/components/PitchScaleVisualizer.tsx` - Visual pitch component
2. `/PITCH_VISUALIZATION_RESEARCH.md` - Research on vocal apps
3. `/PITCH_SCALE_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Implementation details
4. `/STEP_BY_STEP_TESTING_GUIDE.md` - Testing checklist
5. `/CURRENT_STATUS.md` - This file

### Modified Files:
1. `/src/engines/ExerciseEngine.ts` - Added confidence to callback
2. `/src/screens/ExerciseTestScreen.tsx` - Integrated PitchScaleVisualizer

---

## 🔧 TECHNICAL DETAILS

### Pitch Calculation:
```typescript
// Frequency to vertical position
const centsOff = 1200 * Math.log2(frequency / targetFrequency);
const yPosition = -centsOff * 1.6; // pixels

// Color based on cents
if (|centsOff| < 20) return GREEN;
if (|centsOff| < 50) return YELLOW;
return RED;
```

### Animation:
```typescript
Animated.spring(pitchY, {
  toValue: newPosition,
  tension: 80,
  friction: 10,
  useNativeDriver: true // 60fps
});
```
